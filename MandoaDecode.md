# Decoding the Gauntlet Display

This page focuses on decoding the character sequence used in the TV series [The Mandalorian](https://www.starwars.com/series/the-mandalorian) so it can be used to configure an accurate display for cosplay using a [MandoPuter](https://github.com/Breazile/MandoPuter)

## A New Font

If you look closely you will notice that the font used in the gauntlet is different from what was seen in the original Star Wars Series.

## Original Series Font

You can see the font decoded from the original Star Wars series over on the [Erikstormtrooper website](http://www.erikstormtrooper.com/mandalorian.htm). It was decoded from the 2004 Star Wars trilogy DVD set.

This font is useful in trying to decode new characters, or at least making an educated guess of which letter a new font character should be assigned to.
