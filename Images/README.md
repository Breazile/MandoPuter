Image files of various sizes to fit on the LCDs. You may have to rotate them to the orientation that you like.

Copy the file to the CIRCUITPY drive, and then update Code.py with the file that you want to use. For example:

```python
CREST = "Mando240x135.bmp"  # File name of the BMP graphic to be shown after each text sequence
```
